## History    

Pluto extends Polo project :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
```
Polo: Who are you?
Plut0: I'm you but stronger.
```    
 
Polo was created in the beginning of 2017. It was a python/pygame game which aims young children. Main purpose: Explain in simple, what programming is.
Here is Polo: https://github.com/zhufyakvv/Polo  :octocat:    

## Now    
After great success on university conference, I decided to develop Polo. So it's evolved into Plut0.:bomb:      

Plut0 is Web Application. So it's as cross platform as the internet :wink:
The main idea of extension is to let users create levels. And challenge their friends.
