## :books: History    

Pluto extends Polo project
```
Polo: Who are you?
Plut0: I'm you but stronger.
```    
 
Polo was created in the beginning of 2017. It was a python/pygame game which aims young children. Main purpose: Explain in simple, what programming is.     
Here is Polo: [:octocat:](https://github.com/zhufyakvv/Polo)      

## :bomb: Now    
After great success on university conference, I decided to develop Polo. So it's evolved into Plut0.     

Plut0 is Web Application. So it's as cross platform as the internet.
The main idea of extension is to let users create levels. And challenge their friends.
